## 1. User Roles & Binding Rules (Lines 1-11)

### 1.1 Role Rules (Lines 1-5)

| Line | Rule | Schema Implementation |
|------|------|----------------------|
| 1 | user 1 คนมีได้ Role หลัก 1 role, Role รอง 1 role | UserCompanyRoles.PrimaryRoleId, SecondaryRoleId |
| 3 | Requester ≠ Purchasing OR Approver | Application validation |
| 4 | Purchasing CAN BE Requester | SecondaryRoleId can be REQUESTER |
| 5 | User มีหลายบริษัท | UserCompanyRoles (multiple rows per UserId) |

### 1.2 Role Binding Rules (Lines 6-9)

| Line | Role | Binding | Schema Table |
|------|------|---------|--------------|
| 7 | Approver | ผูกกับ ฝ่ายงาน และ Requester | UserCompanyRoles.DepartmentId + ApproverLevel |
| 8 | Purchasing | ผูกกับ Category และ Subcategory | UserCategoryBindings |
| 9 | Purchasing Approver | ผูกกับ Category และ Subcategory และ Purchasing | UserCategoryBindings + ApproverLevel |

### 1.3 Multi-Company/Department (Lines 10-11)

```sql
-- User with multiple companies (Line 5, 10)
SELECT
  u."Id",
  u."Email",
  u."FirstName" || ' ' || u."LastName" AS "FullName",
  ucr."CompanyId",
  c."NameTh" AS "CompanyName",
  ucr."DepartmentId",
  d."NameTh" AS "DepartmentName",
  r."RoleCode" AS "PrimaryRole"
FROM "Users" u
JOIN "UserCompanyRoles" ucr ON u."Id" = ucr."UserId"
JOIN "Companies" c ON ucr."CompanyId" = c."Id"
LEFT JOIN "Departments" d ON ucr."DepartmentId" = d."Id"
JOIN "Roles" r ON ucr."PrimaryRoleId" = r."Id"
WHERE u."Id" = @UserId
  AND ucr."IsActive" = TRUE
ORDER BY ucr."CompanyId";
```

---

## 2. Internal User Notification Rules (Lines 13-18)

### 2.1 Main Notification Rule (Line 14)

**Business Rule:**
```
แต่ละ role จะมีระยะเวลากำหนด (ResponseTimeDays)
ถ้าไม่มี action จะแจ้งเตือนทุกๆ 2 วัน
ถ้าเกิน 2 วัน ไม่มีการ action ใดๆและเลยระยะเวลากำหนด → Status = DELAY (สีแดง)
```

**Schema Implementation:**
```sql
-- ResponseTimeDays configuration (stored in application config or Roles table)
-- Default: 2 days for all roles

-- Calculate if RFQ is delayed
WITH rfq_timeline AS (
  SELECT
    r."Id" AS "RfqId",
    r."CurrentActorId",
    r."CurrentActorReceivedAt",
    ucr."PrimaryRoleId",
    rol."RoleCode",

    -- Calculate days since current actor received
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - r."CurrentActorReceivedAt"))/86400 AS "DaysSinceReceived",

    -- ResponseTimeDays (default 2 days, can be configurable per role)
    2 AS "ResponseTimeDays"

  FROM "Rfqs" r
  LEFT JOIN "UserCompanyRoles" ucr ON (
    r."CurrentActorId" = ucr."UserId"
    AND r."CompanyId" = ucr."CompanyId"
  )
  LEFT JOIN "Roles" rol ON ucr."PrimaryRoleId" = rol."Id"
  WHERE r."Status" = 'PENDING'
    AND r."CurrentActorId" IS NOT NULL
)
SELECT
  "RfqId",
  "CurrentActorId",
  "RoleCode",
  "DaysSinceReceived",
  "ResponseTimeDays",

  -- Determine status
  CASE
    WHEN "DaysSinceReceived" <= "ResponseTimeDays"
    THEN 'ONTIME'
    ELSE 'DELAY'
  END AS "Status",

  -- Check if reminder should be sent (every 2 days)
  CASE
    WHEN FLOOR("DaysSinceReceived" / 2) > (
      SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM "Notifications" n
      WHERE n."RfqId" = rfq_timeline."RfqId"
        AND n."UserId" = rfq_timeline."CurrentActorId"
        AND n."Type" = 'REMINDER'
    )
    THEN TRUE
    ELSE FALSE
  END AS "ShouldSendReminder"

FROM rfq_timeline;
```

### 2.2 Notification Recipients by Role (Lines 15-18)

| Line | Role | Condition | Notify In-App | Email To | Schema Query |
|------|------|-----------|---------------|----------|--------------|
| 15 | REQUESTER | No action for 2 days | ✅ Requester | Requester + Approver หัวหน้า | Next Approver Level 1 |
| 16 | APPROVER | Highest level + No action | ✅ Approver | Approver + Requester | Requester + Current Approver |
| 17 | PURCHASING | No action for 2 days | ✅ Purchasing | Purchasing + Requester + Purchasing หัวหน้า | Purchasing + Requester + Purchasing Approver L1 |
| 18 | PURCHASING_APPROVER | Highest level + No action | ✅ Purchasing Approver | Purchasing Approver + Requester + Purchasing | All three |

## 4. Ontime/Delay Status System (Lines 33-46)

### 4.1 Status Display Rules (Lines 35-37)

**Business Rule:**
```
Status จะแสดงเฉพาะมุมมองของ Role ที่ถือ RFQ อยู่
- ONTIME (สีเขียว) = ยังไม่เลย ResponseTimeDays
- DELAY (สีแดง) = เลย ResponseTimeDays แล้ว
```

**Schema Implementation:**

```sql
-- Calculate Ontime/Delay status from perspective of CURRENT ACTOR

END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Usage:
SELECT * FROM get_rfq_status_for_actor(12345, 67890);
```

### 4.2 Example Scenario (Lines 38-45)

```markdown
Timeline:
Day 0: Requester สร้าง RFQ → ส่งให้ Approver
Day 3: Approver อนุมัติ (ช้า 1 วัน) → ส่งให้ Purchasing
Day 4: Purchasing กำลังดำเนินการ

Status Display:
- Approver view: DELAY (เพราะใช้เวลา 3 วัน แต่กำหนดไว้ 2 วัน)
- Purchasing view: ONTIME (เพราะเพิ่งได้รับวันที่ 3 ยังไม่เลย 2 วัน)
```

**SQL Verification:**

```sql
-- Verify the scenario
WITH timeline_data AS (
  SELECT
    rat."RfqId",
    rat."ActorId",
    rat."ActorRole",
    rat."ReceivedAt",
    rat."ActionAt",
    EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (rat."ActionAt" - rat."ReceivedAt"))/86400 AS "DaysToAct"
  FROM "RfqActorTimeline" rat
  WHERE rat."RfqId" = @RfqId
  ORDER BY rat."ReceivedAt"
)
SELECT
  "ActorRole",
  "ReceivedAt",
  "ActionAt",
  "DaysToAct",
  CASE
    WHEN "DaysToAct" <= 2 THEN 'ONTIME'
    ELSE 'DELAY'
  END AS "Status"
FROM timeline_data;

-- Example output:
-- ActorRole   | ReceivedAt           | ActionAt             | DaysToAct | Status
-- APPROVER    | 2025-09-30 10:00:00 | 2025-10-03 10:00:00 | 3.0       | DELAY
-- PURCHASING  | 2025-10-03 10:00:00 | NULL                 | NULL      | ONTIME (still processing)

  @UserId,
  @ContactId,
  @RfqId,
  @Title,
  @Message,
  @IconType,
  @ActionUrl,
  ARRAY['IN_APP', 'EMAIL'],
  NULL,  -- Send immediately
  CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  @CreatedBy
)
RETURNING "Id";
```

### 7.2 Get Unread Notifications for User

```sql
-- Get unread notifications for internal user
SELECT
  n."Id",
  n."Type",
  n."Priority",
  n."Title",
  n."Message",
  n."IconType",
  n."ActionUrl",

  -- Time ago
  CASE
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - n."CreatedAt"))/60 < 60
    THEN ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - n."CreatedAt"))/60) || ' minutes ago'
    WHEN EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - n."CreatedAt"))/3600 < 24
    THEN ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - n."CreatedAt"))/3600) || ' hours ago'
    ELSE ROUND(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (CURRENT_TIMESTAMP - n."CreatedAt"))/86400) || ' days ago'
  END AS "TimeAgo"
FROM "Notifications" n
LEFT JOIN "Rfqs" r ON n."RfqId" = r."Id"
WHERE n."UserId" = @UserId
  AND n."IsRead" = FALSE
ORDER BY n."Priority" DESC, n."CreatedAt" DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

### 7.3 Mark Notification as Read

```sql
-- Mark notification as read
UPDATE "Notifications" SET
  "IsRead" = TRUE,
  "ReadAt" = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE "Id" = @NotificationId
  AND "UserId" = @UserId;
```

### 7.4 Get Notification Count (Badge)

```sql
-- Get unread notification count for bell badge
SELECT COUNT(*) AS "UnreadCount"
FROM "Notifications"
WHERE "UserId" = @UserId
  AND "IsRead" = FALSE;

## 11. Test Scenarios & Edge Cases

### 11.1 Test Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: 2-Day Reminder Cascade

```
Day 0: RFQ created → Sent to Approver L1
Day 2: No action → Send reminder #1 to Approver L1
Day 4: No action → Send reminder #2 to Approver L1
Day 6: No action → Send reminder #3 to Approver L1
Day 7: Approver L1 approves (DELAY status)

Expected:
- 3 reminders sent (Day 2, 4, 6)
- Status = DELAY (took 7 days, limit was 2 days)
- Color = RED in Approver's view
```

#### Scenario 2: Supplier 24-Hour Warning

```
Day 0: Supplier invited, deadline = Day 7 at 17:00
Day 6 at 17:00: 24 hours remaining → Send warning
Day 7 at 17:00: Deadline reached → Auto-decline if no response

Expected:
- Warning sent exactly 24 hours before deadline
- Warning sent only once (check WarningSent flag)
- Auto-decline happens via Wolverine job
```

#### Scenario 3: Multi-Role User Notifications

```
User A:
- Primary Role: PURCHASING
- Secondary Role: REQUESTER
- Companies: Company A, Company B

Scenario:
1. As REQUESTER: Creates RFQ in Company A
2. As PURCHASING: Handles RFQ in Company B

Expected:
- Notifications filtered by context (role + company)
- Bell shows notifications for current role only
- Can switch company → See different notifications
```

### 11.2 Edge Cases

#### Edge Case 1: Notification During Approval Chain

```sql
-- Test: Approver L2 receives notification while L1 is still processing
-- Timeline:
-- Day 0: Requester → Approver L1
-- Day 1: Approver L1 approves → Approver L2
-- Day 2: Reminder sent (to whom?)

Expected:
- Day 2 reminder goes to Approver L2 (current actor)
- Approver L1 does NOT receive reminder (already acted)
```

#### Edge Case 2: Supplier Declines After Warning

```sql
-- Test: Supplier receives 24h warning, then declines
-- Should stop sending reminders after decline

WITH supplier_status AS (
  SELECT
    ri."Decision",
    ri."RespondedAt"
  FROM "RfqInvitations" ri
  WHERE ri."Id" = @InvitationId
)
SELECT
  CASE
    WHEN "Decision" = 'NOT_PARTICIPATING'
    THEN 'STOP_REMINDERS'
    ELSE 'CONTINUE_REMINDERS'
  END AS "ReminderStatus"
FROM supplier_status;
```

#### Edge Case 3: Notification During Role Switch

```javascript
// Test: User switches from REQUESTER role to PURCHASING role
// Should update SignalR group membership

async function switchRole(newRole) {
    // Disconnect from current role group
    await connection.invoke("LeaveRoleGroup", currentRole);

    // Connect to new role group
    await connection.invoke("JoinRoleGroup", newRole);

    // Reload notifications for new role
    await loadNotifications(newRole);
}
```
